### Python Data Science Handbook (for Dummies like me)

Completely inspired by Jake's Python Data Science Handbook I decided to redo the examples in the Jupyter Notebooks from scratch in a way that even the most beginner of beginners could understand.

In hopes that someone with no python or data science experience can follow.

I will be supplementing these notebooks with videos on my [YT](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHTqK9UTcXw99HWKQjmAi7g?view_as=subscriber) channel as well
